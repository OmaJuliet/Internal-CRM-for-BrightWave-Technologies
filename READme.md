# üìÅ Project Documentation: BrightWave Internal CRM System

## üìå Project Overview

### Company's Vision and Goals

To streamline customer acquisition, sales, and onboarding workflows, BrightWave Technologies aims to develop a centralized internal **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system. This tool will replace disjointed spreadsheet-based tracking with an integrated solution that enhances visibility, coordination, and customer intelligence.

### Objectives

* Improve **lead tracking** and visibility across the sales pipeline.
* Unify **marketing, sales, and customer success** workflows.
* Enable efficient **customer onboarding** and support.
* Empower **data-driven decisions** through customer interaction analytics.

## üîç Process Taken

### 1. Problem Understanding

* Understood the pain points: disorganized spreadsheets, communication silos, lack of real-time updates, no unified customer view.


### 2. Stakeholder Interviews (Simulated)

Interviewed the following stakeholders:

* **Sales Manager (Jane)** ‚Äì Struggles with real-time visibility of lead progress.
* **Marketing Manager (Tom)** ‚Äì Wants marketing campaigns tied to lead outcomes.
* **Customer Success Manager (Amy)** ‚Äì Needs a centralized view of onboarding and customer support tickets.


### 3. Requirements Gathering

Used stakeholder insights to derive:

* **Business requirements**
* **Functional & Non-functional requirements**
* **User stories**


### 4. Prioritization

Applied the **MoSCoW method** to rank requirements.
